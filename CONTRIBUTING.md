## Branch Workflow

**⚠️ IMPORTANT:** Yonyou Doc2Skill uses a two-branch workflow.

### Branch Structure

```
main (production)
  ↑
  │ (only maintainer merges)
  │
development (integration) ← default branch for PRs
  ↑
  │ (all contributor PRs go here)
  │
feature branches
```

### Branches

- **`main`** - Production branch
  - Always stable
  - Only receives merges from `development` by maintainers
  - Protected: requires tests + 1 review

- **`development`** - Integration branch
  - **Default branch for all PRs**
  - Active development happens here
  - Protected: requires tests to pass
  - Gets merged to `main` by maintainers

- **Feature branches** - Your work
  - Created from `development`
  - Named descriptively (e.g., `add-github-scraping`)
  - Merged back to `development` via PR

### Workflow Example

```bash
# 1. Fork and clone
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/yonyou_doc2skill.git
cd yonyou_doc2skill

# 2. Add upstream
git remote add upstream https://github.com/yonyou/yonyou-doc2skill.git

# 3. Create feature branch from development
git checkout development
git pull upstream development
git checkout -b my-feature

# 4. Make changes, commit, push
git add .
git commit -m "Add my feature"
git push origin my-feature

# 5. Create PR targeting 'development' branch
```

## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs

Before creating bug reports, please check the [existing issues](https://github.com/yonyou/yonyou-doc2skill/issues) to avoid duplicates.

**Example:**
```markdown
**Bug:** MCP tool fails when config has no categories

**Steps to Reproduce:**
1. Create config with empty categories: `"categories": {}`
2. Run `python3 cli/doc_scraper.py --config configs/test.json`
3. See error

**Expected:** Should use auto-inferred categories
**Actual:** Crashes with KeyError

**Environment:**
- OS: Ubuntu 22.04
- Python: 3.10.5
- Version: 1.0.0
```

### Suggesting Enhancements

   - Brief description of the framework
   - Test results (number of pages scraped, categories found)

**Example PR:**
```markdown
**Add Svelte Documentation Config**

Adds configuration for Svelte documentation (https://svelte.dev/docs).

- Config: `configs/svelte.json`
- Tested with max_pages: 100
- Successfully categorized: getting_started, components, api, advanced
- Total pages available: ~150
```

### Pull Requests

We actively welcome your pull requests!

**⚠️ IMPORTANT:** All PRs must target the `development` branch, not `main`.

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `development`
2. If you've added code, add tests
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation
4. Ensure the test suite passes
5. Make sure your code follows our coding standards
6. Issue that pull request to `development` branch!

## Coding Standards

### Python Style Guide

We follow [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) with some modifications:

- **Line length:** 100 characters (not 79)
- **Indentation:** 4 spaces
- **Quotes:** Double quotes for strings
- **Naming:**
  - Functions/variables: `snake_case`
  - Classes: `PascalCase`
  - Constants: `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE`

### Code Organization

```python
# 1. Standard library imports
import os
import sys
from pathlib import Path

# 2. Third-party imports
import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

# 3. Local application imports
from cli.utils import open_folder

# 4. Constants
MAX_PAGES = 1000
DEFAULT_RATE_LIMIT = 0.5

# 5. Functions and classes
def my_function():
    """Docstring describing what this function does."""
    pass
```

### Documentation

- All functions should have docstrings
- Use type hints where appropriate
- Add comments for complex logic

```python
def scrape_page(url: str, selectors: dict) -> dict:
    """
    Scrape a single page and extract content.

    Args:
        url: The URL to scrape
        selectors: Dictionary of CSS selectors

    Returns:
        Dictionary containing extracted content

    Raises:
        RequestException: If page cannot be fetched
    """
    pass
```

### Code Quality Tools

We use **Ruff** for linting and code formatting. Ruff is a fast Python linter that combines multiple tools (Flake8, isort, Black, etc.) into one.

**Running Ruff:**

```bash
# Check for linting errors
uvx ruff check src/ tests/

# Auto-fix issues
uvx ruff check --fix src/ tests/

# Format code
uvx ruff format src/ tests/
```

**Common Ruff Rules:**
- **SIM102** - Simplify nested if statements (use `and` instead)
- **SIM117** - Combine multiple `with` statements
- **B904** - Use `from e` for proper exception chaining
- **SIM113** - Use enumerate instead of manual counters
- **B007** - Use `_` for unused loop variables
- **ARG002** - Remove unused function arguments

**CI/CD Integration:**

All pull requests automatically run:
1. `ruff check` - Linting validation
2. `ruff format --check` - Format validation
3. `pytest` - Test suite

Make sure all checks pass before submitting your PR:

```bash
# Run the same checks as CI
uvx ruff check src/ tests/
uvx ruff format --check src/ tests/
pytest tests/ -v
```

**Pre-commit Setup (Optional):**

You can set up pre-commit hooks to automatically run Ruff before each commit:

```bash
# Install pre-commit
pip install pre-commit

# Set up hooks (if .pre-commit-config.yaml exists)
pre-commit install

# Run manually
pre-commit run --all-files
```

---

## Testing

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
python -m pytest tests/ -v

# Run specific test file
python -m pytest tests/test_mcp_server.py -v

# Run with coverage
python -m pytest tests/ --cov=cli --cov=mcp --cov-report=term
```

### Writing Tests

- Tests go in the `tests/` directory
- Test files should start with `test_`
- Use descriptive test names

```python
def test_config_validation_with_missing_fields():
    """Test that config validation fails when required fields are missing."""
    config = {"name": "test"}  # Missing base_url
    result = validate_config(config)
    assert result is False
```

### Test Coverage

- Aim for >80% code coverage
- Critical paths should have 100% coverage
- Add tests for bug fixes to prevent regressions

---

## Documentation

### Where to Document

- **README.md** - Overview, quick start, basic usage
- **docs/** - Detailed guides and tutorials
- **CHANGELOG.md** - All notable changes
- **Code comments** - Complex logic and non-obvious decisions

### Documentation Style

- Use clear, simple language
- Include code examples
- Add screenshots for UI-related features
- Keep it up to date with code changes

```

**Scraper pattern (17 source types):** Each source type has `cli/<type>_scraper.py` (with `<Type>ToSkillConverter` class + `main()`), `arguments/<type>.py`, and `parsers/<type>_parser.py`. Register new types in: `parsers/__init__.py` PARSERS list, `main.py` COMMAND_MODULES dict, `config_validator.py` VALID_SOURCE_TYPES set.

### UML Architecture

Full UML class diagrams are maintained in StarUML and synced from source code:

- **[docs/UML_ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/UML_ARCHITECTURE.md)** - Overview with embedded PNG diagrams
- **[docs/UML/yonyou_doc2skill.mdj](docs/UML/yonyou_doc2skill.mdj)** - StarUML project (open with [StarUML](https://staruml.io/))
- **[docs/UML/exports/](docs/UML/exports/)** - 14 PNG exports (package overview + 13 class diagrams)
- **[docs/UML/html/](docs/UML/html/index.html/index.html)** - HTML API reference

**Key design patterns documented in UML:**
- Strategy + Factory in Adaptors (SkillAdaptor ABC + 20+ implementations)
- Strategy + Factory in Storage (BaseStorageAdaptor + S3/GCS/Azure)
- Template Method in Parsers (SubcommandParser + 28 subclasses)
- Template Method in Analysis (BasePatternDetector + 10 GoF detectors)
- Command pattern in CLI (CLIDispatcher + COMMAND_MODULES lazy dispatch)

When adding new classes or modules, please update the corresponding UML diagram to keep architecture docs in sync.
