## Design Principles

1. **Immutable after creation** — Use `@dataclass(frozen=True)` for segments and frames. Once extracted, data doesn't change.
2. **Serializable** — Every data class must serialize to/from JSON for caching, output, and inter-process communication.
3. **Timeline-aligned** — Every piece of data has `start_time` and `end_time` fields. This is the alignment axis for merging streams.
4. **Confidence-scored** — Every extracted piece of content carries a confidence score for quality filtering.
5. **Source-aware** — Every piece of data traces back to its origin (which video, which stream, which tool).
6. **Compatible** — Output structures must be compatible with existing Yonyou Doc2Skill page/reference format for seamless integration.
